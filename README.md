The following question-and-answers are for course requirements.

- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

  To interpret and implement user needs, it is important to gather information about the target audience through user research methods such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups. This can provide insights into the goals, motivations, and pain points of potential users. It can also be helpful to create personas, which are fictional representations of the typical user, to better understand the user's needs and how the program can meet them.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  When developing programs, it can be helpful to approach the process with an agile mindset. Agile methodologies focus on flexibility and iterative development, allowing for rapid prototyping and adjustments based on user feedback. This can involve holding regular meetings, known as "sprint reviews," to discuss progress and make any necessary changes.
  Other agile practices that may be useful to incorporate into future development work include using a cross-functional team, prioritizing the most valuable features first, and regularly demonstrating progress to stakeholders. By adopting an agile approach, you can be more responsive to changing requirements or priorities and deliver a high-quality product in a timely manner.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Being a good team member in software development requires strong communication skills and the ability to work well with others. It is important to be open to feedback and willing to collaborate with team members to find solutions. It is also crucial to be able to effectively manage your time and meet deadlines, as well as being able to adapt to changing requirements or priorities.
  In addition to technical skills, being a good team member in software development also involves being a positive and supportive presence on the team. This can involve actively listening to and respecting the ideas and opinions of others, as well as being willing to lend a helping hand when needed. Overall, being a good team member means being able to contribute to the success of the project and the team.
